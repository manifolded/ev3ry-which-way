# ev3ry-which-way

ev3ry which way is our tail-dragging tank drive robot which weâ€™re using as the testbed for our new ev3dev OS on our EV3.   Equipped with a gyro for steering feedback, an infrared for obstacle detection and a touch sensor for collision detection it has the potential to be a fairly sophisticated room wanderer, but its real purpose is for us to get some experience programming the EV3 platform in ev3 Python.
